      <h3>Tsukatsuki Rio</h3>
      <hr>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>Rio is the student council president of Millennium. Cold and calculating, she cares more about objective facts than emotions. She is at odds with Himari due to their contrasting personalities. Her nickname is "Big Sister."</p>

      <h4>Personality</h4>
      <p>Rio has always been unsociable and rather scrupulous. She never lets emotions change her mind and always sticks to the facts. Her determination to identify and analyze potential threats to Millennium and Kivotos at large has led her to develop an extensive surveillance system. This has given her a terrifying reputation among the student body, which she personally ignores. Rio is also very determined when it comes to reaching her goals, even breaking the rules if she has to.</p>

      <img src="Styles/Assets/Rio_Halo.webp" style="width:100%; margin-top:10px;">
      <h4>Uniform</h4>
      <p>Her uniform consists of a three-buttoned black blazer and a white long-sleeved turtleneck sweater, a black knife-pleated mini skirt with black opaque pantyhose, black stiletto heels, and a holster with two belts tightly attached to her right thigh. She wears a Millennium ID on her left chest, a Millennium logo hairpin, and a square watch.</p>

  <h3>Ushio Noa</h3>
  <hr>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>Noa is the secretary of the student council "Seminar" at Millennium Science School. She has an exceptional memory and can recall nearly anything she sees or hears after a single exposure, including decisions made at the Seminar and detailed records of meetings.</p>
  <p>She is briefly mentioned twice in Clockwork Flower Pavane.</p>

  <h4>Personality</h4>
  <p>Noa is a helpful and reliable member of Seminar. Her remarkable memory allows her to record nearly everything said during meetings, as well as subtle details of locations that others may overlook. This makes her both a capable investigator and a keen observer. She maintains a calm demeanor and often wears a subtle, long‑held smile.</p>
  <p>Noa has been friends with Yuuka for a long time and occasionally teases her, especially about her feelings toward Sensei. Despite her gentle appearance, she is the only member of Seminar capable of intimidating Koyuki into cooperating.</p>
  <p>Her hobbies include poetry, often written with complex or archaic terminology. She lives an ascetic lifestyle, believing minimalism helps her remain an impartial observer.</p>

  <h4>Halo</h4>
  <img src="Styles/Assets/Noa_Halo.webp" style="width:100%; margin-top:10px;">
  <h4>Uniform</h4>
  <p>Noa’s uniform includes white and blue low‑heel boots, black tights, a pleated white skirt, and a blazer with a tech‑adorned jacket draped over her arms. Under the blazer, she wears a white dress shirt and blue tie, with her Millennium access card clipped to the blazer’s side pocket.</p>

  <h3>Hayase Yuuka</h3>
  <hr>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>The treasurer of the Millennium Academy Student Council, "Seminar". She is strict about money and often clashes with other clubs due to her firm stance on budgeting.</p>
  <p>A prominent mathematical genius even among Millennium’s STEM‑focused students, she oversees the academy’s budget management. She is skilled with the abacus and often counts it to calm herself when dealing with complex or stressful situations.</p>

  <h4>Personality</h4>
  <p>Yuuka is generally polite, professional, and easy to work with when treated respectfully. However, many of the people she deals with are difficult, and combined with her strict standards, this often leads to frustrated outbursts. This gives her a reputation for being cold and ruthless, though she is not. Around her fellow Millennium students, she gives off the impression of a tired, hard‑working mother.</p>
  <p>She takes great pride in her mathematical abilities, to the point of stubbornly refusing to accept randomness in a poker game with Sensei, which makes her easy to manipulate. Her pride also leads her to cover up her own mistakes, such as splitting a receipt to pretend she spent less than 10,000 yen on chocolate for Sensei.</p>
  <p>Yuuka is endlessly annoyed by Sensei’s spending habits, as she is responsible for managing their expenses. Despite this, she admires their dedication to the students and their tactical skill. Because of this, she has developed romantic feelings for Sensei, which she struggles with — much to Noa’s amusement.</p>

  <h4>Halo</h4>
  <img src="Styles/Assets/Yuuka_Halo.webp" style="width:100%; margin-top:10px;">
  <h4>Uniform</h4>
  <p>She wears a standard uniform, along with a white and blue hoodie, a black and white blazer clipped with Millennium access badge, a tucked-in white shirt with blue tie underneath and a black pleated skirt. The latter styling a white belt with attached bullet pouches. She wears sleeveless black gloves on both her hands, and a pair of black boots with blue tags.

  <h3>Kurosaki Koyuki</h3>
  <hr>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>Koyuki is a troublemaker who has returned to Millennium's student council, Seminar. She has a natural talent for deciphering mathematical codes, though she seems completely unaware of her own abilities.</p>
  <p>A prodigious cryptanalyst, she can crack even the toughest digital encryption systems purely through intuition. Due to her frequent encounters with C&C and her general harmlessness, she is on somewhat friendly terms with them and even calls the members of C&C "Senpai." Her nickname is "White Rabbit."</p>

  <h4>Personality</h4>
  <p>Koyuki is arguably the most irresponsible known student in Kivotos. She rarely acknowledges her mistakes and almost always believes her actions are correct, which often leads to major problems for Millennium. She frequently meddles in other people's business, uncovering secrets without permission simply for fun.</p>
  <p>Despite this, she has moments of guilt and embarrassment, such as when she discovered numerous confiscated adult magazines belonging to other students.</p>

  <h4>Appearance</h4>

  <h4>Halo</h4>
  <img src="Styles/Assets/Koyuki_Halo.webp" style="width:100%; margin-top:10px;">
  <h4>Uniform</h4>
  <p>During the events of <em>Bunny Chaser on Board</em>, Koyuki wears a white tailcoat, a black leotard, a Millennium access badge, white tights, and black high heels. The inner lining of her tailcoat is black with a pattern of yellow crosses. Around her neck is a detached collar and the standard Millennium necktie.</p>
  <p>She wears white half‑palm gloves and carries a white and black top hat with a yellow interior, though she does not wear it. Instead, she wears black and yellow rabbit ears, completing her playboy bunny‑themed look.</p>

  <h3>Kagami Chihiro</h3>
  <hr>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>Chihiro is the deputy director of the hacker group Veritas. Although she possesses outstanding abilities, she avoids abusing them and often acts as the conscience of Veritas, a group known for its mischievous members.</p>

  <h4>Personality</h4>
  <p>As one of the most skilled hackers in Veritas, Chihiro is highly capable yet far more restrained than her peers. While the rest of the group frequently engages in spying, hacking, and cracking for personal reasons, Chihiro tries to keep them from going too far.</p>
  <p>She is often called upon as a security consultant to strengthen both physical and digital safety measures throughout Kivotos. Despite the heavy workload, she is secretly proud of being relied on, comparing herself to a coffee machine that continues serving through the night. However, she becomes irritated when those she helps make her job harder by being careless with their security.</p>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>The leader of Millennium’s secret organization, Cleaning & Clearing (C&C).</p>
  <p>Despite looking like a delinquent with her sukajan jacket worn over a maid uniform, she takes great pride in being the strongest agent in the business, boasting a flawless 100% success rate. Because of this, she earned the codename “Double O,” a symbol of victory within the industry.</p>

  <h4>Personality</h4>
  <p>Neru is harsh, blunt, and combative toward others, often showing irritation when asked to perform actual cleaning or typical maid duties. In combat, however, she becomes highly enthusiastic and confidently claims to be unmatched in close‑quarters combat — a claim she can easily prove.</p>
  <p>She has no regard for collateral damage and will destroy anything necessary to complete her mission. She also has a strong Napoleon Complex, and comments about her height quickly enrage her. Despite her rough exterior, she deeply cares for her team, though she rarely shows it openly.</p>

  <p>She is known as the “Sweeper Master” for her ability to infiltrate enemy lines with a deceptively gentle demeanor and then gracefully — yet explosively — “clean out” hostile forces.</p>

  <h4>Personality</h4>
  <p>Akane is caring in Sensei’s presence, acting as their personal maid and performing duties such as cleaning, supply management, and general housekeeping. She also displays a matronly attitude toward Neru, much to Neru’s annoyance.</p>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>An agent of Millennium’s secret organization, C&C. Her codename is “zero‑one,” and she is a veteran known for overcoming countless challenges through brutal instinct, sharp intuition, and extraordinary luck.</p>
  <p>On missions, she is openly trusting of others and dismisses doubt or hesitation. Her actions are often difficult to understand, yet they never fail to produce results.</p>

  <h4>Personality</h4>
  <p>Asuna is the most energetic and upbeat member of C&C. She behaves like a cheerful, happy‑go‑lucky child due to her playful personality, and like Izuna, she is frequently seen smiling. She often acts on whims and gut feelings, but her intuition and luck consistently lead her to success.</p>
  <p>Her feats include perfectly organizing Sensei’s documents without ever having seen them and earning an “S”‑rank card aboard the Golden Fleece, which allowed her to free her teammates and Sensei from detainment. However, she suffers from memory issues when she is not given a task to focus on.</p>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>Toki is the mysterious fifth member of C&C with the codename “04” (Zero‑Four) in Millennium. Unlike the rest of C&C, she is assigned as Rio’s personal bodyguard at Seminar. She is equipped with special armaments designed by Rio. The first is the “Mode 1” uniform, a standard maid uniform that allows her to shift into “Mode 2,” a simplified maid uniform that greatly enhances her mobility. The second is a large powered exoskeleton named “Abi‑Eshuh” (アビ・エシェフ), which contains heavy weaponry and can utilize Eridu’s entire electricity grid and processing power.</p>
  <p>Because she has worked alone for most of her life, a lonely side has developed within her.</p>

  <h4>Personality</h4>
  <p>Toki is consistently serious and emotionless, fitting for Rio’s personal bodyguard. She remains calm under pressure and quickly grasps the situation during missions.</p>

  <p>In Mode 2, her long sleeves and skirt are removed, revealing her codename “04” on her left elbow glove. Her gloves and high heels become white armored pieces that protect her limbs up to her elbows and knees.</p>
  <p>Before equipping Abi‑Eshuh, she removes her Mode 2 uniform, revealing a delft blue and black leotard and a black leg band with a buckle on her left thigh. She also wears a specialized visor to assist with tracking and targeting.</p>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>Himari is a genius hacker. She was the former head of Veritas and is the current head of the Paranormal Affairs Department. She is one of only three students in Millennium’s history to achieve a degree of Omniscience. Her skills in information gathering and hacking are considered the best in Millennium Science School.</p>
  <p>At the request of Student Council President Rio, she now leads the Paranormal Affairs Department, leaving Veritas in the hands of her colleagues.</p>
  <p>Due to her body’s lack of strength, she uses a wheelchair. Despite her fragile appearance, she has a bold and confident personality.</p>

  <h4>Personality</h4>
  <p>Himari is exceptionally intelligent and fully aware of her reputation. She enjoys boasting about herself and often inserts her many self‑given nicknames — such as “Beautiful Sickly Girl” and “Genius Hacker” — at the most inappropriate times.</p>
  <p>She is very honest, sometimes to a fault, and expresses her thoughts openly. She strongly believes in freedom, which puts her at odds with Rio, whose nature leans toward control.</p>

  <h3>Saiba Midori</h3>
  <hr>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>The illustrator for the Game Development Department at Millennium. Both she and her older twin sister, Momoi, develop video games together in the department.</p>
  <p>Although her shy personality is the opposite of her cheerful sister, their passion for games is strikingly similar, making them excellent partners.</p>

  <h4>Personality</h4>
  <p>Contrasting Momoi, Midori is quieter and more reserved, only showing strong reactions when angered or excited. She is just as passionate about gaming as her sister, though she is less easily offended and a bit more pessimistic.</p>
  <p>Regarding their feelings toward Sensei, Midori is the more openly romantic of the two, though both sisters insist on hiding any romantic interactions — especially from each other.</p>

  <h3>Tendou Aris</h3>
  <hr>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>Originally designated as AL‑1S, Alice is a mysterious member of Millennium’s Game Development Department. She was discovered in an abandoned munitions factory in the Ruins, and no information about her origin or age can be recovered.</p>
  <p>She enjoys playing games with Yuzu, Momoi, and Midori, becoming a serious game fanatic whose speech often consists of lines taken from retro games.</p>
  <p>Alice is later revealed to be a member of the Nameless Gods, specifically the “Princess” (王女). She also possesses another side known as Key (ケイ), an AI whose role was to guide Alice in carrying out a genocidal campaign for the Nameless Priests.</p>
  <p>She is once again called into action under Sensei’s supervision, following Himari’s orders, to confront a rising threat alongside the Game Development Department.</p>

  <h4>Personality</h4>
  <p>When first discovered, Alice behaved robotically, speaking in terms of systems, data files, and search queries. After playing the JRPGs available in the Game Development Department, her personality shifted dramatically overnight. She developed a form of “chuunibyou syndrome,” seeing herself as the hero of her own story.</p>
  <p>She frequently uses JRPG terminology, referring to her friends as her “party” and daily tasks as “quests.” Despite her eccentricities, she is curious, sweet‑natured, eager to learn, and makes friends easily. Her arcade game skills are surpassed only by Yuzu. Until recently, she feared maids due to a violent encounter with Neru.</p>
  <p>By the time Aris experienced her journey with the group, Alice had grown more determined and eager to save others and clear quests together with her club.</p>

  <h4>Halo</h4>
  <img src="Styles/Assets/Alice_Halo.webp" style="width:100%; margin-top:10px;">
  <h4>Uniform</h4>
  <p>She wears a standard Millennium high‑school uniform: a white and blue hoodie, a tucked‑in white shirt with a blue tie, a pleated black skirt, woolly socks, and white sneakers with gray shoelaces.</p>
  <p>Her Millennium access badge was artificially crafted by Veritas, and her clothes are hand‑me‑downs from Midori.</p>
